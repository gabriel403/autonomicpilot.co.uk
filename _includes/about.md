#About: ME!

Welcome to autonomicpilot.co.uk, my name is Gabriel and I will be your host for this journey into insanity.

I'm currently system's developer for [Fusions](https://fusionspim.com), producing PHP code, maintaining systems and develop automation techniques (think [puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/), [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), [jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) and [packer](http://www.packer.io/)) to streamline development and deployment.

I am formally a dev-op for [Go MAD Thinking](http://www.gomadthinking.com/), dev-op being a combination of tech op and developer, I developed software as well maintained infrastructure.

I maintain an open source deployment platform with an api built on Ruby on Rails and a front end in JS and HTML.

I also contribute to [various](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2) [open](https://github.com/Block8/PHPCI) [source](https://github.com/bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize) projects in my spare time, mainly focused on PHP. I had written my own [markdown website handler](https://github.com/gabriel403/autonomicpilot.co.uk) but now I use jekyll and github pages.

My work projects have consisted of [Fusions](https://fusionspim.com), [D & A](http://www.danda.co.uk/), [Support Rebel](https://supportrebel.com/), [iCheev](http://www.icheev.com), [Think Leicestershire](http://www.thinkleicestershire.co.uk), [Go MAD Kids](http://www.gomadkids.com) and currently lead developer on the corporate administration site for iCheev.

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/gabriel403), [github](https://github.com/gabriel403), [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/gabriel403), [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/499332/gabriel-baker). If you see the username gabriel403 somewhere, it's probably me.

My main languages are PHP/RoR/C#.net with oodles of JQuery, Bootstrap and Dojo JS as well.

I'm a graduate of De Montfort University, gaining a 1st class degree with honours in software engineering.

It seems fairly standard that at this point I should show you what I look like, so here is my foot:

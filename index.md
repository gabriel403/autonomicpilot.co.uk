            Welcome to autonomicpilot.co.uk, my name is Gabriel and I will be your host for this journey into insanity.
        </p>
        <p>
            I work for a company called Go MAD Technology developing propriety websites and web applications by day
            <br />
            but by night I'm an open source coding monkey.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've worked on work projects such as <a href='http://www.icheev.com'>iCheev</a>, <a href='http://www.thinkleicestershire.co.uk'>Think Leicestershire</a> and am currently lead developer on <a href='http://www.gomadkids.com'>Go MAD Kids</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            And I've also worked on personal projects such as this blog, Zend Framework 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can find me on <a href='https://twitter.com/gabriel403'>twitter</a>, <a href='https://github.com/gabriel403'>github</a>, <a href='http://uk.linkedin.com/in/gabriel403'>LinkedIn</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            My work is mainly PHP/C#.net with oodles of Dojo JS as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a recent graduate of De Montfort University, gaining a 1st class degree with honours in software engineering.

            It seems fairly standard that at this point I should show you what I look like, so here is my foot:
            <br />
            <a href='/css/me.jpg'><img height="163px" width="122px" src="/css/me_small.jpg" /></a>
